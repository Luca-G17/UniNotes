# Artificial Life
Both AI and ALife take a functionalist approach

- AI - an artificial system can be intelligent if it is organised right

- ALife - An artificial system can be alive if it is organised right.

- Strong ALife - Creating life inside a computer or in a robot

- Weak ALife - Understanding life by building life-like systems
