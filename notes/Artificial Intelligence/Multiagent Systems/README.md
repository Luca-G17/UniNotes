# Multiagent Systems
## Agents:

An agent is a computer system that is capable of performing independent actions on behalf of its users or owners.

An agent figures out what needs to be done to satisfy its usersâ€™ goals, rather than being told what to do.

<br/>

For successful interaction agents must:

- Coordinate

- Negotiate

- Cooperate

<br/>

An agent is autonomous capable of deciding for itself and performing different actions.

<br/>

**Sense-Decide-Act Loop:**

- Engage in a close-coupled loop

- Continually interact with the environment

Agents sense the environment they perceive the result from their sensors then they execute some action with effectors.

**Properties of intelligent agents:**

- Reactivity

- Proactivity

- Social ability

<br/>

**Reactivity:**

A reactive system is one that maintains an ongoing interaction with its environment and responds to changes that occur in the environment

A response needs to be in-time for it to be useful

<br/>

**Proactivity:**

- Systematically working to achieve a goal

- Anticipate and take initiative

<br/>

**Social Ability:**

Social ability in agents is the ability to interact with other agents via a communication language

- Coordinate

- Negotiate

- Cooperate

## Environment:

Properties:

- Accessibility

- Determinism

- Episodic/Non-episodic

- Static/Dynamic

<br/>

Accessibility:

Agents have or can obtain complete, accurate and up-to-date information about the state of the environment.

<br/>

Determinism:

A deterministic environment is one in which each action has a single guaranteed effect, there is no uncertainty about the resulting state.

<br/>

Episodic/Non-episodic:

In an episodic environment performance of an agent is dependent on a number of discrete episodes, there is no link between the performance of an agent in different scenarios.

<br/>

Static/Dynamic:

Static environments remain unchanged except by the performance of actions by the agent, they are entirely predictable.

Dynamic environments can be changed by other agents or processes.

<br/>

**Sociotechnical System:**

An STS includes social entities - principals (Humans/Organisations) and other stakeholders as well as technical entities such as agents and resources

An STS is not a separate running entity but it is realised through the interactions of principals, agents and resources.

<br/>

Norm - A directed social expectation between principals, defines a standard of correctness

Accountability - A principal can call another to account for its actions, derives from norms and provides opportunity for principals to explain their actions
